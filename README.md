### Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Michael, a front-end developer based in Lagos, Nigeria.
I'm very passionate about building beautiful and responsive user interfaces.

ðŸ¤  Iâ€™m a self-taught developer who enjoy the ongoing pursuit of knowledge and skills outside of the formal education system. I love collaborating with people from different background and experience in order to achieve organizational goals. Besides programming, I like traveling, gaming, hiking, and watching sport.
